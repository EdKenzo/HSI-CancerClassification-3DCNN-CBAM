Conversion of MATLAB DataCubes to NumPy format DataCubes: datacube_mat_to_npz.ipynb

Preprocessing and patch extraction: preprocessing_patch_extraction.ipynb

3D CNN and attention mechanism: 3DCNN_CBAM

Dataset can be found at: https://zenodo.org/records/4730312


Directions:
1) Save the Matlab DataCubes (DataCube.7z) and annotated chemical images (overlay.7z) provided in the link above.
2) Run datacube_mat_to_npz.ipynb to convert the MATLAB files into NPZ format
3) Run preprocessing_patch_extraction.ipynb to preproces the spectral data and extract patches
4) Run the model in 3DCNN_CBAM to reproduce results
