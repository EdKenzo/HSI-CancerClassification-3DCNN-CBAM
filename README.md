Dataset: https://zenodo.org/records/4730312


Instructions:
1) Download the Dataset: Save the Matlab DataCubes (DataCube.7z) and annotated chemical images (overlay.7z) provided in the link above.
2) Convert to NumPy format: Run datacube_mat_to_npz.ipynb to convert the MATLAB files into NPZ format.
3) Preprocess and extract patches: Run preprocessing_patch_extraction.ipynb to preproces the spectral data and extract patches.
4) Train the model: Open 3DCNN_CBAM and run the model to reproduce results.
